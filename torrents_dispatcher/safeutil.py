This is a script designed to be "safe" drop-in replacements for the
shutil move() and copyfile() functions.

These functions are safe because they should never overwrite an
existing file. In particular, if you try to move/copy to dst and
there's already a file at dst, these functions will attempt to copy to
a slightly different (but free) filename, to avoid accidental data loss.

def _increment_filename(filename, marker='-'):
    """
    Returns a generator that yields filenames with a counter. This counter
    is placed before the file extension, and incremented with every iteration.

    For example:

        f1 = increment_filename("myimage.jpeg")
        f1.next() # myimage-1.jpeg
        f1.next() # myimage-2.jpeg
        f1.next() # myimage-3.jpeg

    If the filename already contains a counter, then the existing counter is
    incremented on every iteration, rather than starting from 1.

    For example:

        f2 = increment_filename("myfile-3.doc")
        f2.next() # myfile-4.doc
        f2.next() # myfile-5.doc
        f2.next() # myfile-6.doc

    The default marker is an underscore, but you can use any string you like:

        f3 = increment_filename("mymovie.mp4", marker="_")
        f3.next() # mymovie_1.mp4
        f3.next() # mymovie_2.mp4
        f3.next() # mymovie_3.mp4

    Since the generator only increments an integer, it is practically unlimited
    and will never raise a StopIteration exception.
